# How Hard is This Game? A Study of Board Game Instructions
For my final project in L&S 88, an exploration of text as data, I explored the textual features of board game instructions.
I built a model to classify games as easy, medium, or hard based on the text and metadata of their instructions.

I compiled a paper detailing my methods, results, and analysis, which you can view [here](https://github.com/rachelphillips1/text-connector/blob/master/How%20Hard%20is%20This%20Game%3F.docx).

You can see the [Jupyter Notebook](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-sync?repo=https://github.com/rachelphillips1/text-connector) here.
